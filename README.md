## Installation
Our challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them. We will install the following applications. Jest and Inquirer. 



## Usage
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles  

## Credits
List your collaborators, I was fortunate enough to get additional assistance from class mates either during office hours or during private study group sessions after class. I truly appreciate any help that I have received throughout this project.

## Tests
Great way to test the program is by using node index.js, review the terminal for any errors. You can also console log data to see how the program is running and what information is being pulled through.
